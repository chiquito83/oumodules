        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is a very simple API which allows you to get basic information about
            OU's modules (module name, code, number of credits etc.). The data is scraped daily from
            The Open University's <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/all">website</a>  and provided in JSON format. You might find it useful if you are
            building some productivity app, degree prediction calculator etc. It uses jsoup for HTML parsing,
            MySQL and Hibernate for data persistence and Spark framework for mapping requests.

        <h2>How to use</h2>

        <p>You can either get info about a particular module using its code or download
            information about all modules. At the moment you can use following GET requests:

        <p> <samp>adriangrabowski.com/oumodules/v1/modules</samp> <strong>for all modules </strong></p>
        <p> <samp>adriangrabowski.com/oumodules/v1/modules/MODULE_CODE</samp> <strong>for a particular module, e.g.:</strong> </p>
        <p> <samp>adriangrabowski.com/oumodules/v1/modules/m250</samp> <strong>will return the following JSON: </strong></p>
        <p> <code> {"code":"m250","name":"Object-oriented Java programming","uri":"/courses/modules/m250","level":"2","scqfLevel":"8","fheqLevel":"5","description":"This module teaches the fundamental ideas behind the object-oriented approach to programming through the widely-used Java programming language. Concentrating on aspects of Java that best demonstrate object-oriented principles and good practice,
            youâ€™ll gain a solid basis for further study of the Java language and object-oriented software development. Some experience in writing computer programmes is essential - see the Am I ready? section.
            Modules count towards OU qualifications OU qualifications are modular in structure; the credits from this undergraduate module could count towards a certificate of higher education, diploma of higher education, foundation degree or honours degree.",
